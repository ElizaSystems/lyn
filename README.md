## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Setting Up Real Security Features

**The security features require API keys to function properly.** See [SECURITY_SETUP.md](./SECURITY_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Getting free API keys from security providers
- Configuring environment variables
- Testing the real scanning capabilities

Without API keys, the app will use fallback pattern matching (less accurate).
